### Sorting Algorithms

|Algorithm|Description|Time Complexity|Uses In Java|
|---|---|---|---|
|`BubbleSort`|Bubble sort works by swapping adjacent elements if they're not in the desired order.<br> This process repeats from the beginning of the array until all elements are in order.|O(n^2)||
|`InsertionSort`|The idea behind Insertion Sort is dividing the array into the sorted and unsorted subarrays.|O(n^2)||
|`SelectionSort`|divides the array into a sorted and unsorted subarray|O(n^2)||
|`MergeSort`|uses recursion to solve the problem of sorting|O(nlog n)||
|`HeapSort`||O(log n)||
|`QuickSort`|Divide and Conquer algorithm|O(n^2)||
